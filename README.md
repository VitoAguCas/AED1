Flowerbed:
This code was entirelly made in class, the test cases were with these parameters:

  -case 1:( flowerbed , 5 , 1 ) //int flowerbed[] = { 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 };
  
  -case 2:( flowerbed , 5 , 2 ) //int flowerbed[] = { 1 , 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 };
  
  -case 3:( flowerbed , 1 , 1 ) // int flowerbed[] = { 0 };

in this code, everything worked fine, thou it did take some trial and error cause i kept forgetting  the exceptions, such as case 3, in wich the vector had only 1 in lenght.
